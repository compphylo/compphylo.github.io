# MESS (Massive Eco-Evolutionary Synthesis Simulations) - Part II

This is the second part of the MESS tutorial in which we introduce the API mode
using jupyter notebooks. In this tutorial we'll walk through the entire simulation 
and analysis process. This is meant as a broad introduction to familiarize 
users with the general workflow, and some of the parameters and terminology. 
We will use as an example in this tutorial the __??????__ data set from
__?????__. However, you can follow along with one of the other example
data sets if you like and although your results will vary the procedure will 
be identical. 

## MESS Part II Outline
* [Crash course in machine learing](#ML-Intro)
* [Introducing Jupyter notebooks](#Jupyter-NB-Intro)
* [Setting up and connecting to a notebook server on the cluster](#NB-Cluster-Setup)
* [Create and parameterize a new MESS Region](#Create-MESS-Region)
* [Run MESS simulations in API mode](#Simulate-MESS-API)
* [ML assembly model classification](#MESS-API-Classification)
* [ML parameter estimation](#MESS-API-Regression)

Each grey cell in this tutorial indicates a command line interaction. 
Lines starting with `$ ` indicate a command that should be executed 
in a terminal connected to the cluster, for example by copying and 
pasting the text into your terminal. Elements in code cells surrounded 
by angle brackets (e.g. <username>) are variables that need to be 
replaced by the user. All lines in code cells beginning with \#\# are 
comments and should not be copied and executed. All other lines should 
be interpreted as output from the issued commands.

```bash
## Example Code Cell.
## Create an empty file in my home directory called `watdo.txt`
$ touch ~/watdo.txt

## Print "wat" to the screen
$ echo "wat"
wat
```
