ForBio and UiO:Life Science jointly offer a generator workshop on model-based 
demographic inferences of both single species and communities. The workshop 
aims to learn and apply new tools to elucidate phylogeographic patterns, 
biogeographic shifts and demographic responses of single- and multi-taxa as well 
as to contribute to knowledge exchange on methodological challenges and diverse 
biological systems for this cutting-edge field of research.
