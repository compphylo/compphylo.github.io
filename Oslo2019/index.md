ForBio and UiO:Life Science jointly offer a generator workshop on model-based 
demographic inferences of both single species and communities. The workshop 
aims to learn and apply new tools to elucidate phylogeographic patterns, 
biogeographic shifts and demographic responses of single- and multi-taxa as well 
as to contribute to knowledge exchange on methodological challenges and diverse 
biological systems for this cutting-edge field of research.

Buses on local routes run about every 20-30 minutes all day long. **NB:** Some 
of the express busses stop at Seiersten, which is a 10 minute walk from the 
station. We are assuming most people will leave on Friday Sept 28 at the end 
of the day, but let us know if this is not the case.

### Station logistics and meals
ForBio covers the accommodation of all participants. We are all staying at 
Tollboden biological station, where the workshop will also take place. This is 
a simple but well equipped building, with a kitchen, lab space and rooms. 
Rooms will be shared. Bed linen and towels will be provided. ForBio is also 
paying for meals of all participants. We will share cooking and tidying up in 
the kitchen. You have indicated you food preferences in the registration form 
but if there is anything else we would need to know, please contact me directly.
