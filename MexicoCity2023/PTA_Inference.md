# Phylogeographic Temporal Analysis (PTA)
## Inferring shared demographic response using machine learning

> ### **Questions:**
>
> - What exactly do I do with all these PTA simulations?
> - How does machine learning (ML) simulation-based inference work?
> - What do the ML results *tell* me?
> 
> ### **Learning objectives:**
>
> - Understand ML classification and regression.
> - Implement ML inference with toy data and pre-baked simulations.
> - Plot and interpret ML inference.
> - Understand the steps to reproduce this analysis with your own data on your own computer.

### Accessing a jupyter notebook on the cloud

### PTA API mode

### Download pre-baked simulations and toy empirical data
**NB:** Here we can play the game where we give them a simulated dataset with a known zeta and see if they can figure it out.


### ML classification (model selection)


### Interpreting ML classification results

### ML regression (parameter estimation)



### Interpreting ML regression results

### Next steps: How do run this on your *own* data
