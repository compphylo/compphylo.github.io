# Phylogeographic Temporal Analysis (PTA)
## Simulating community-scale co-demographic histories

> ### **Questions:**
>
> - How do I run PTA simulations?
> - What parameters can I cange and how do I change them?
> - What do the simulations results look like?
> 
> ### **Learning objectives:**
>
> - Run PTA simulations in the cloud.
> - Create, view, and edit the PTA parameters file.
> - Understand key model parameters.
> - Place prior ranges on model parameters.
> - View and interpret simulation outputs.

### Launch PTA in the cloud
For the purpose of this workshop we are running PTA using **Binder**,
which allows for running github repositories in a free, small
and isolated cloud compute instance. This allows us to side-step the (boring)
installation process and operate in a homogeneous computing environment.  
**Click the link below to launch PTA in a new tab.**

> #### **NOTE:** Binder instances are *ephemeral*!
> The down-side of Binder is that the virtual machines they provide are
> _ephemeral_, meaning that if you leave it sitting long enough or if you
> close your tab, everything you have done will be lost. For the purpose of
> a workshop this is totally fine because we'll be using toy data and all
> the steps to reproduce your work will be documented on this page. **For the
> purpose of real work you will not want to use Binder** (small amount of
> resources and inability to save your work), so at the end of the workshop
> we will provide instructions on how to install PTA and perform analysis
> on your own computer or HPC system.
>
> That all being said, Binder is still really cool and useful. ;)
